### Research Experience 

* 2017 - 2021: DPhil, Anatomically informed Bayesian inference for physiological imaging  
*Supervised by Professor Michael Chappell, funded by the Bellhouse Scholarship for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oxford* 
    - Developed a suite of computational tools for surface analysis of neuroimaging data
    - Developed a framework for combined volumetric and surface-based Bayesian inference of arterial spin labelling data 
    - Work led to one publication, one patent and numerous conference posters; further publications are in preparation     

* 2020: Design and development of an emergency Covid-19 ventilator (OxVent)
    - Joint effort between the University of Oxford and Smith & Nephew to develop an emergency device; the UK government ordered 6000 units 
    - Responsibile for overall system integration and calibration
    - Authored multiple technical documents for the UK healthcare regulator (MHRA)

* 2016 - 2017: MEng, Perfusion quanitifcation in the clinic  
Supervised by Professor Michael Chappell 
    - Developed a clinical facing app using the MeVisLab platform to simplify and facilitate the use of arterial spin labelling  for perfusion measurement 

### Education 

* 2017 - 2021: DPhil Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford 
* 2013 - 2017: MEng Engineering, Economics and Management, University of Oxford (First class)
