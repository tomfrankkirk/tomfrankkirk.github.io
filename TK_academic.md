## Research Experience 
----

* 2017 - 2021: **DPhil, Anatomically informed Bayesian inference for physiological imaging**  
*Supervised by Professor Michael Chappell, funded by the Bellhouse Scholarship for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oxford* 
    - Developed a suite of computational tools for surface analysis of neuroimaging data
    - Developed a framework for combined volumetric and surface-based Bayesian inference of arterial spin labelling data 
    - Work led to two publications, one patent and numerous conference posters; further publications are in preparation     

* 2020: **Design and development of an emergency Covid-19 ventilator (OxVent)**
    - Joint effort between the University of Oxford and Smith & Nephew to develop an emergency device; the UK government ordered 6000 units 
    - Responsible for overall system integration and calibration
    - Authored multiple technical documents for the UK healthcare regulator (MHRA)
    - An overview of this project has been [published](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103868) in the Lancet eBioMedicine

* 2016 - 2017: **MEng, Perfusion quantification in the clinic**  
*Supervised by Professor Michael Chappell*
    - Developed a clinical facing app using the MeVisLab platform to simplify and facilitate the use of arterial spin labelling  for perfusion measurement 

## Education
