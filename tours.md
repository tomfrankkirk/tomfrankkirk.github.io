# Tours 

The following pages were generated using tourmapper, a Python wrapper for the Folium / Leaflet interactive mapping libraries. 

## Tour de France 

*September - October 2021* A two month solo tour around France to celebrate finishing my PhD (and being able to travel again after Covid). [Map](../tdf_map/tdf_map.html)

## Scotland 

*July 2021* Sort-of following the NC500 around the highlands of Scotland immediately after leaving university. [Map](../tour_maps/scotland.html)
