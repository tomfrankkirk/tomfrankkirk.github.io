# **Tours** 

The following pages were generated using [tourmapper](https://github.com/tomfrankkirk/tourmapper), a tool for building interactive maps from GPS activity data using the Leaflet / Folium libraries. 

## Tour de France 

*September - October 2021* A two month solo tour around France to celebrate finishing my PhD (and being able to travel again after Covid). [Map](../tour_maps/tdf.html)

## Scotland 

*July 2021* Sort-of following the NC500 around the highlands of Scotland immediately after leaving university. [Map](../tour_maps/scotland.html) 

## Pacific Coast 
*May 2019* First multi-day tour: 10 days along the Pacific coast in the US, from Eugene, OR to San Francisco, CA. It was wet, wet, wet. [Map](../tour_maps/pacific.html) 

## Ontatio 
*June 2023* Five-day warm up before ISMRM in Toronto (and it was warm due to a heatwave). Incredibly I managed to avoid the terrible forest fires further east entirely, though when I got back to Toronto the smoke caught up with me. [Map](../tour_maps/ontario.html)
