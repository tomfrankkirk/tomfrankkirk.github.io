I am a biomedical engineer with skills in software development and data science. 

I was awarded my DPhil from Oxford University in September 2021 for research into surface-based variational Bayesian inference technqiues of physiological imaging data to improve the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. This work was funded by the Bellhouse Scholarship in biomedical engineering at Magdalen College, Oxford.
