I am a biomedical engineer with skills in neuroimaging, software development and data science. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford in September 2021 with a DPhil awarded for research into surface-based variational Bayesian inference techniques on physiological imaging data. This work was funded by the Bellhouse Scholarship in biomedical engineering at Magdalen College, Oxford.
