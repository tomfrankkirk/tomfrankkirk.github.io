I am a biomedical engineer with excellent skills in software development and data science. I have previously worked on projects in [neuroimaging](https://github.com/physimals/hcp-asl), [medical devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103868) and [vaccine distribution](https://vaximap.org). I am particularly good at proof-of-concept work and rapid prototyping tasks, ie, getting things off the ground quickly. 

I graduated from the University of Oxford in 2021 with a DPhil awarded for research into surface-based variational Bayesian inference on physiological imaging data. This work was funded by the Bellhouse Scholarship in biomedical engineering at Magdalen College, Oxford.
